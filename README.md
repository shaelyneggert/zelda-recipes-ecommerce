# `Zelda Recipes E-Commerce Site` 

In my network-based application development class, I opted to craft an e-commerce platform where users could indulge in purchasing cherished recipes from two iconic Zelda games, Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild. 
Throughout the span of four months, I immersed myself in the intricacies of crafting dynamic websites, leveraging the Node.js and Express.js framework, alongside MongoDB for database management. 
This journey not only honed my skills in web development but also fueled my passion for creating immersive online experiences.


## Description
This project aimed to replicate an e-commerce platform, enabling users to register, sign in, place offers on items, and list their own items. 
Through the process, I gained proficiency in database navigation, leveraging MongoDB to render data dynamically on the website. 
I also delved into implementing validation protocols and bolstering security measures, including the integration of bcrypt for password encryption and the utilization of flash messages for enhanced user feedback.
